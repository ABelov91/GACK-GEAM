# GACK-GEAM

MATLAB package for solution of the chemical kinetics problem (the abbreviation is Guaranteed Accuracy for Chemical Kinetics and utilizing GEometrically Adative Mesh in the arc length argument).
The package includes chemical reactions database (file "Reactions.txt", currently, on hydrogen combustion in oxygen). The package fits for stand-alone using and as a part of applied programs for gas dynamics with chemical kinetics. To test it, put all files in one folder and run "EXAMPLE.m"
